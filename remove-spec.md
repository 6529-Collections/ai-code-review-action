 🎯 Domains to Remove for Radical Simplification

  1. Line/Size Counting & Metrics ❌

  - linesAdded, linesRemoved, linesModified
  - totalLines calculations
  - targetLeafSize configurations
  - Size-based complexity scoring
  - All line-based atomic detection

  2. Function/Class/Module Counting ❌

  functionCount: this.countFunctions(theme),
  classCount: this.countClasses(theme),
  moduleCount: this.countModules(theme),
  Why remove: AI can see function definitions in the diff itself!

  3. Change Type Classification ❌

  changeTypes: this.identifyChangeTypes(theme),
  // Results in: ['config', 'logic', 'ui', 'test']
  Why remove: AI can read file paths and content to understand change types!

  4. Code Complexity Analysis ❌

  codeComplexity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  complexityIndicators: {
    hasConditionals: boolean,
    hasLoops: boolean,
    hasErrorHandling: boolean,
    nestingDepth: number,
    branchingFactor: number
  }
  Why remove: AI can analyze code complexity from the actual diff!

  5. File Structure Analysis ❌

  fileStructure: {
    directories: Set<string>,
    fileExtensions: Set<string>,
    isMultiDirectory: boolean,
    isMultiLanguage: boolean,
    hasTestFiles: boolean,
    hasConfigFiles: boolean
  }
  Why remove: AI can see file paths and determine structure!

  6. Pre-extracted Function/Class Names ❌

  functionsChanged: string[];
  classesChanged: string[];
  importsChanged: string[];
  Why remove: AI can read function names from the diff content!

  7. File Type Detection ❌

  fileType: string;
  isTestFile: boolean;
  isConfigFile: boolean;
  Why remove: AI can determine file types from paths and content!

  8. Architectural Pattern Detection ❌

  architecturalPatterns: string[];
  businessDomain: string;
  Why remove: AI can identify patterns from reading the actual code!

  9. Expansion Hints Generation ❌

  expansionHints: string[];
  // Results in: "Multiple functions modified (5) - separate for independent testing"
  Why remove: AI can generate its own expansion reasoning!

  10. Business Domain Extraction ❌

  businessDomains: string[];
  businessContext: string;
  Why remove: AI can understand business context from code and comments!

  11. Similarity Calculations ❌

  similarity: 0.0-1.0
  semanticSimilarity: number
  Why remove: AI can determine similarity by comparing actual code!

  12. Significance Detection ❌

  const largeChanges = changes.filter(c => c.linesAdded > 50);
  Why remove: AI can judge significance from reading the changes!

  🎯 What We Keep (Minimal Data Structure)

  Only Essential Information:

  interface SimpleCodeChange {
    filename: string;           // ← AI needs to know which file  
    diffPatch: string;          // ← AI reads the actual changes
    changeType: 'added' | 'modified' | 'deleted' | 'renamed';  // ← Git status
  }

  That's It!

  Everything else gets deleted:
  - ❌ No metrics extraction
  - ❌ No complexity analysis
  - ❌ No function counting
  - ❌ No file type detection
  - ❌ No pattern recognition
  - ❌ No hint generation
  - ❌ No similarity scoring

  🚀 The Massive Simplification

  Files/Classes to DELETE Entirely:

  1. code-structure-analyzer.ts - 2,400+ lines ❌
  2. ai-code-analyzer.ts - 1,000+ lines ❌
  3. business-domain.ts - 500+ lines ❌
  4. ai-semantic-analyzer.ts - 800+ lines ❌
  5. similarity-calculator.ts - 600+ lines ❌
  6. theme-similarity.ts - 700+ lines ❌
  7. All complexity/metrics interfaces ❌

  Result:

  - Remove ~6,000+ lines of over-engineering
  - Replace with ~50 lines of simple diff passing
  - AI gets raw, unprocessed information
  - AI makes all decisions based on actual code

  This would be the most radical simplification possible - trusting AI to read code instead of trying to
  pre-digest everything for it!
