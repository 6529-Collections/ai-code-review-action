# Quality Improvements - Active Todos

*Auto-generated from improvement state and recent analysis - Current cycle focus*

## Current Quality Status
- **Grade**: B+ (87/100) - Baseline established
- **Target**: A grade (95/100+) by end of cycle
- **Key Issue**: Theme Name Variation Algorithm identified
- **References**: `state:improvement-state:quality-grade`, `cmd:/review-results:B+-analysis`

## ðŸŽ¯ **High Priority** (Current Cycle Critical)

### T001: Implement Theme Name Variation Algorithm
**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Context**: Quality  
**Priority**: High (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  

**Description**: 
THE ONE IMPROVEMENT identified from review-results. Theme names currently lack variation and distinctiveness, impacting quality grade. Need to implement algorithm that generates more varied and descriptive theme names.

**References**:
- `cmd:/review-results:THE-ONE-IMPROVEMENT`
- `cmd:/review-logs:theme-naming-patterns`
- `state:improvement-state:cycle-1-priority`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Analyze current theme naming patterns
- [ ] Design variation algorithm for theme names
- [ ] Implement algorithm in theme-naming service
- [ ] Test with sample mindmap outputs
- [ ] Measure quality grade improvement (target: B+ â†’ A-)

**Related**: T002 (business classification), T003 (PRD alignment)

### T002: Fix Business vs Technical Classification
**Status**: Analysis needed  
**Context**: Quality  
**Priority**: High (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  

**Description**:
Business theme classification accuracy is inconsistent. Need to improve AI's ability to distinguish between business capabilities and technical implementation details.

**References**:
- `cmd:/meta-review:business-classification-accuracy`
- `state:improvement-state:documentation-gaps:business-examples`
- `cmd:/review-results:business-alignment-assessment`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add concrete business examples to mindmap PRD
- [ ] Update AI prompts with better business/technical distinction
- [ ] Test classification accuracy on sample changes
- [ ] Measure improvement in business alignment percentage
- [ ] Document successful classification patterns

**Related**: T001 (theme naming), T004 (PRD examples)

## ðŸ“‹ **Medium Priority** (Next Steps)

### T003: Align PRD with Actual Behavior  
**Status**: Investigation required  
**Context**: Quality + Infrastructure  
**Priority**: Medium (Impact: Medium, Effort: Medium)  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  

**Description**:
Current PRD documents contain promises that don't match actual system behavior. Need systematic review and alignment to ensure PRD accuracy.

**References**:
- `cmd:/meta-review:PRD-vs-reality-gaps`
- `state:improvement-state:documentation-accuracy-40%`
- `cmd:/improve-mindmap-prd:alignment-needs`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Compare mindmap-prd.md claims vs actual behavior
- [ ] Update PRD with accurate capability descriptions
- [ ] Add concrete examples for abstract concepts
- [ ] Validate PRD accuracy with test runs
- [ ] Update documentation accuracy metric

**Related**: T002 (business classification), T005 (documentation sync)

### T004: Add Concrete Examples to PRDs
**Status**: Ready to start  
**Context**: Quality + Infrastructure  
**Priority**: Medium (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low)  
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  

**Description**:
PRDs currently contain abstract concepts without concrete examples. Adding examples will improve AI understanding and consistency.

**References**:
- `cmd:/meta-review:concrete-examples-needed`
- `state:improvement-state:self-improvement-queue:business-examples`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add 10+ business theme examples to mindmap PRD
- [ ] Add technical vs business distinction examples
- [ ] Add atomic change examples with explanations  
- [ ] Test examples with actual analysis runs
- [ ] Measure improvement in classification consistency

**Related**: T002 (business classification), T003 (PRD alignment)

## ðŸ’¡ **Low Priority** (Future Consideration)

### T005: Develop Confidence Calibration System
**Status**: Research phase  
**Context**: Quality + Innovation  
**Priority**: Low (Impact: Medium, Effort: High)  
**Effort**: 1+ weeks  

**Description**:
Current confidence scores don't always correlate with actual quality. Research and develop system to better calibrate AI confidence with human judgment.

**References**:
- `cmd:/review-logs:confidence-analysis`
- `state:improvement-state:innovation-opportunities`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Research confidence calibration techniques
- [ ] Analyze current confidence vs quality correlation
- [ ] Design calibration algorithm
- [ ] Implement and test calibration system
- [ ] Measure improvement in confidence accuracy

**Related**: T001 (theme quality), T002 (classification accuracy)

## ðŸ“Š **Quality Metrics Tracking**

### Current Metrics
- **Overall Grade**: B+ (87/100)
- **Coverage Completeness**: 95% (5/5 files covered)
- **Business Theme Quality**: 80% (4/5 roots business-focused)
- **Atomic Leaf Accuracy**: 100% (all leaves unit-testable)
- **Hierarchy Naturalness**: 85% (good depth distribution)

### Target Metrics (End of Cycle)
- **Overall Grade**: A (95/100+)
- **Coverage Completeness**: 100%
- **Business Theme Quality**: 90%+
