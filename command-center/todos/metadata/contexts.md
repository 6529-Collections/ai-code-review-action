# Todo Context System

*Defines how todos are automatically categorized by functional area*

## Context Categories

### üéØ **Quality** (Improving Analysis Accuracy)
- **Focus**: Grade improvements, accuracy, confidence levels

### üí° **Innovation** (New Approaches, Research)
- **Focus**: New features, research, experimental approaches
- **Keywords**: new, pattern, learning, AI, approach, experiment, research
- **Current Goals**: Build foundation for next-generation improvements
- **Related Commands**: /meta-review (innovation opportunities)
- **Success Metrics**: Successful experiments, new capability delivery

**Example Todos**:
- Create pattern library for successful approaches
- Implement AI decision learning system
- Develop cross-cycle trend analysis
- Experiment with semantic similarity caching

### üìã **Process** (Workflow, Methodology)
- **Focus**: Improvement cycle workflow, methodology refinement
- **Keywords**: cycle, workflow, process, methodology, improvement
- **Current Goals**: Optimize improvement cycle effectiveness
- **Related Commands**: /cycle-report, /next
- **Success Metrics**: Cycle completion time, improvement velocity

**Example Todos**:
- Optimize /next command decision logic
- Add cycle efficiency tracking
- Develop workflow automation opportunities
- Create success pattern documentation

## Context Detection Rules

### Auto-Assignment Logic
```
Quality Context:
- Contains: grade, accuracy, confidence, theme, business, classification
- OR: Related to /review-results, /review-logs output
- OR: Mentions PRD alignment or quality metrics

Performance Context:  
- Contains: speed, cache, optimization, time, performance
- OR: Related to timing, latency, or efficiency
- OR: Mentions cache hits, processing speed

Infrastructure Context:
- Contains: command, documentation, validation, system
- OR: Related to .claude/commands/ files
- OR: Mentions documentation updates, command fixes

Innovation Context:
- Contains: new, pattern, learning, AI, approach, experiment
- OR: Related to research or experimental features
- OR: Mentions future capabilities or novel approaches

Process Context:
- Contains: cycle, workflow, process, methodology
- OR: Related to improvement cycle operations
- OR: Mentions workflow optimization or automation
```

### Multi-Context Todos
Some todos may span multiple contexts:
- **Primary Context**: Main area of impact (used for organization)
- **Secondary Contexts**: Additional areas affected (tagged for reference)
- **Cross-Context Items**: Explicitly marked for coordination across areas

### Context Priority by Cycle Focus
Current cycle focus area gets priority boost:

- **Quality Focus Cycle**: Quality context todos get +1 priority
- **Performance Focus Cycle**: Performance context todos get +1 priority  
- **Infrastructure Focus Cycle**: Infrastructure context todos get +1 priority
- **Innovation Focus Cycle**: Innovation context todos get +1 priority

## Context Review and Maintenance

### **Auto-Categorization** (Every /todo command)
- Apply context detection rules to new todos
- Re-evaluate existing todos if keywords change
- Update context tags based on current cycle focus

### **Context Validation** (Weekly)
- Review auto-assigned contexts for accuracy
- Identify cross-context dependencies
- Rebalance context workloads

### **Context Evolution** (Per-Cycle)
- Add new contexts as system grows
- Retire obsolete contexts
- Update detection rules based on usage patterns
