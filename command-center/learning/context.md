# AI Context for Improve Command

## User Patterns Discovered
*This section will grow as the command learns from your usage patterns*

- Initial state: No patterns discovered yet
- Implementation preferences: To be determined
- Context usage: To be analyzed
- Workflow patterns: To be observed

## System State Knowledge
*This section accumulates knowledge about your system over time*

### Current System State
- Review system: Fully implemented and functional
- Mindmap generation: Working with hierarchical analysis
- Performance: Some bottlenecks identified in test results
- Code quality: Mixed - some areas need improvement

### Recent Observations
- Review processing: 87s for 3 nodes (could be optimized)
- Test outputs: Generating detailed analysis and review data
- Git activity: Active development with regular commits
- PRD alignment: Some gaps between documentation and implementation

## Command Evolution History
*This section tracks how the improve command has adapted over time*

### Version 1.0 (Initial)
- Equal weights for all improvement categories
- Basic pattern recognition
- Simple context parsing
- No learning from user behavior

### Future Evolution
- Will adapt based on your actual usage patterns
- Will learn which suggestions you implement
- Will optimize for your specific workflow
- Will become more relevant over time

## Learning Notes
*This section contains insights for future command improvements*

### Patterns to Watch For
- Which improvement categories get implemented vs ignored
- How often specific contexts are used
- What types of issues are most important to the user
- How the user's preferences change over time

### Adaptation Strategies
- Adjust priority weights based on implementation rates
- Improve context interpretation based on usage
- Modify suggestion formats based on user feedback
- Enhance learning algorithms based on effectiveness

## Context Interpretation Guide
*This section helps the command understand what you mean by different contexts*

### Performance Context
Keywords: performance, speed, slow, fast, optimization, bottleneck, timing
Focus: System performance, AI processing speed, response times

### Quality Context  
Keywords: quality, clean, code, refactor, structure, maintainability
Focus: Code organization, best practices, technical debt

### PRD Context
Keywords: prd, document, alignment, strategy, specification, requirements
Focus: Documentation accuracy, implementation vs design alignment

### Logging Context
Keywords: log, logging, debug, trace, monitoring, observability
Focus: Logging improvements, debugging capabilities, system monitoring

### Review Context
Keywords: review, analysis, ai, decision, confidence, accuracy
Focus: AI review quality, decision accuracy, review effectiveness

## Self-Improvement Triggers
*This section defines when the command should update its own behavior*

### Pattern Recognition Triggers
- Implementation rate drops below 50% for a category
- Specific context used more than 5 times
- Clear preference pattern emerges over 10+ runs
- User consistently ignores certain types of suggestions

### Adaptation Actions
- Adjust category priority weights
- Update context keyword mapping
- Modify suggestion formatting
- Enhance pattern recognition algorithms

## Future Enhancements
*This section contains ideas for improving the improve command itself*

### Planned Features
- More sophisticated natural language context parsing
- Integration with external tools and metrics
- Predictive suggestions based on code patterns
- Collaborative filtering based on similar projects

### Experimental Ideas
- Sentiment analysis of user responses
- Integration with IDE and development tools
- Machine learning for suggestion optimization
- Community-driven improvement patterns
