# Intent-Based Architecture Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the transformation of our AI code review system from feature-based analysis to intent-based analysis. Instead of categorizing changes by what they affect ("Enhance AI Code Review Reliability"), we'll categorize by what they're trying to achieve ("Systematic Removal: Eliminate algorithmic fallbacks").

This fundamental shift solves our core problem: the AI reviewer currently doesn't understand what the code is trying to accomplish, leading to false positives and contextually inappropriate feedback.

## Current State vs Future State

### Current State
```
Root: "Enhance AI Code Review Reliability" (feature/capability)
├── "Remove Response Validation Fallbacks" (what changed)
├── "Replace Domain Analysis Fallbacks" (what changed)
└── "Convert Complexity Analysis to AI-First" (what changed)
```

### Future State
```
Root: "Systematic Removal: Eliminate all algorithmic fallbacks" (intent)
├── "Response Validation: Fallback removal" (intent application)
├── "Domain Analysis: Fallback removal" (intent application)
└── "Complexity Analysis: Pattern matching removal" (intent application)
```

## Phase 1: Intent Detection System

### 1.1 Intent Taxonomy

Define the core intent types that can be detected:

#### Structural Intents
- **Systematic Removal**: Removing a pattern across the codebase
- **Systematic Addition**: Adding a pattern across the codebase
- **Refactoring**: Changing implementation while preserving behavior
- **Optimization**: Improving performance characteristics
- **Hardening**: Adding validation, error handling, or security

#### Behavioral Intents
- **Feature Addition**: New capabilities
- **Bug Fix**: Correcting incorrect behavior
- **API Change**: Modifying contracts/interfaces
- **Configuration Change**: Adjusting settings/parameters

#### Meta Intents
- **Cleanup**: Removing dead code, fixing style
- **Documentation**: Adding/updating comments and docs
- **Testing**: Adding/modifying tests

### 1.2 Intent Detection Algorithm

```typescript
interface DetectedIntent {
  type: IntentType;
  confidence: number;
  evidence: Evidence[];
  scope: 'full-pr' | 'partial' | 'mixed';
  conflictsWith?: DetectedIntent[];
}

interface Evidence {
  pattern: string; // e.g., "consistent removal of try-catch blocks"
  fileCount: number;
  exampleLocations: Location[];
  consistency: number; // 0-1, how consistent is this pattern
}
```

#### Detection Strategy

1. **Pattern Analysis Phase**
   - Analyze all diffs to identify repeated patterns
   - Group similar changes across files
   - Calculate pattern consistency scores

2. **Intent Inference Phase**
   - Map patterns to likely intents
   - Score each possible intent based on evidence
   - Identify conflicting patterns

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   - High confidence (>0.8): Single dominant pattern
   - Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): Clear pattern with exceptions
   - Low confidence (<0.5): Mixed patterns or unclear intent

### 1.3 Implementation Steps

1. Create intent detection service
2. Build pattern recognition for each intent type
3. Implement confidence scoring algorithm
4. Add intent validation against code changes
5. Create feedback loop for intent detection accuracy

## Phase 2: Hierarchical Restructuring

### 2.1 New Node Structure

```typescript
interface IntentAwareNode {
  // Identity
  id: string;
  level: number;
  
  // Intent context
  intent: DetectedIntent;
  intentAlignment: 'supports' | 'contradicts' | 'unrelated';
  
  // Current fields
  name: string;
  description: string;
  businessImpact: string;
  
  // New intent-aware fields
  intentContribution: string; // How this change serves the intent
  completeness: number; // 0-1, how completely this implements the intent
  consistency: ConsistencyCheck;
}

interface ConsistencyCheck {
  withIntent: boolean;
  withSiblings: boolean;
  issues?: string[];
}
```

### 2.2 Hierarchy Generation Changes

The hierarchy generation must now:

1. Start with detected intents as roots
2. Group changes under appropriate intent
3. Flag changes that don't fit any intent
4. Detect incomplete intent implementation
5. Identify contradictory changes

### 2.3 Multi-Intent Handling

When multiple intents are detected:

```
Root: "Mixed Intent PR - Consider Splitting"
├── Intent 1: "Systematic Removal: Algorithmic fallbacks"
│   ├── [Changes supporting this intent]
│   └── Completeness: 85% (3 fallbacks remain)
├── Intent 2: "Enhancement: Add logging"
│   ├── [Changes supporting this intent]
│   └── Completeness: 60% (missing in error paths)
└── Unaligned Changes
    └── [Changes not fitting any intent]
```

## Phase 3: Intent-Aware Review System

### 3.1 Review Prompt Templates

Each intent type needs specialized review prompts:

#### For Systematic Removal
```
Intent: Systematic removal of {pattern}
Expected: All instances of {pattern} should be removed
Review Focus:
- Verify all instances are removed (check for missed spots)
- Ensure removal doesn't break dependencies
- Confirm no partial removals that leave inconsistent state
DO NOT flag the removals themselves as issues
```

#### For Refactoring
```
Intent: Refactoring {component} 
Expected: Behavior unchanged, implementation improved
Review Focus:
- Verify behavior preservation
- Check for regression risks
- Ensure refactoring is complete
- Validate new pattern is consistently applied
```

### 3.2 Review Evaluation Matrix

| Intent Type | Critical Issues | Major Issues | Minor Issues |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Removal | Incomplete removal, broken dependencies | Inconsistent removal | Style in remaining code |
| Refactoring | Behavior changes, broken tests | Incomplete refactoring | Old pattern remains |
| Enhancement | Feature doesn't work | Feature incomplete | Polish issues |
| Bug Fix | Fix doesn't work, creates new bugs | Fix incomplete | Code quality |

### 3.3 Cross-Intent Validation

New validation layer that checks:
- Changes under intent A don't break requirements of intent B
- No contradictory changes across intents
- Shared files modified by multiple intents maintain consistency

## Phase 4: Task Generation Evolution

### 4.1 Intent-Aware Tasks

Tasks now include intent context:

```typescript
interface IntentAwareTask {
  id: string;
  intent: DetectedIntent;
  
  // Intent-specific fields
  taskType: 'complete-intent' | 'fix-inconsistency' | 'resolve-conflict';
  
  // Why this task matters for the intent
  intentJustification: string;
  
  // Standard task fields
  priority: Priority;
  description: string;
  suggestedFix: string;
  
  // New validation
  completesIntent: boolean; // Will this task complete the intent?
  intentProgress: number; // 0-1, how much this moves toward intent
}
```

### 4.2 Task Prioritization by Intent

Different intents prioritize different task types:

- **Removal intents**: Prioritize finding missed instances
- **Enhancement intents**: Prioritize making the feature work
- **Refactoring intents**: Prioritize consistency and behavior preservation
- **Bug fix intents**: Prioritize verifying the fix works

### 4.3 Task Batching Strategy

Group tasks that:
1. Serve the same intent
2. Touch the same files
3. Have no conflicts
4. Can be verified together

## Phase 5: Feedback and Learning

### 5.1 Intent Detection Accuracy

Track:
- How often human agrees with detected intent
- Which patterns successfully predict intent
- False positive/negative rates by intent type

### 5.2 Review Effectiveness

Measure:
- False positive rate by intent type
- Issues missed by intent type
- Task completion success by intent type

### 5.3 Continuous Improvement

1. Build pattern library from successful intent detections
2. Refine confidence scoring based on outcomes
3. Adjust review prompts based on false positive patterns
4. Evolve task generation based on completion rates

- Auto-generate intent documentation

## Conclusion

This shift from feature-based to intent-based analysis addresses our core challenge: understanding what the code is trying to achieve. By detecting and respecting intent throughout the analysis pipeline, we can dramatically reduce false positives while maintaining comprehensive issue detection.

The key insight: **Code review isn't about finding what's wrong with code in abstract - it's about finding what prevents the code from achieving its intended purpose.**
