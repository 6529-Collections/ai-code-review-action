# Product Requirements Document: Dynamic AI-Powered PR Mindmap

## Vision Statement
Create an intelligent, self-organizing mindmap that adapts its depth to match the complexity of code changes, ensuring every change is represented at its natural level of abstraction - from high-level business themes down to atomic, testable code units.

## Core Concept
An AI-driven system that:
- **Dynamically determines depth** based on change complexity
- **Self-organizes** into natural hierarchical structures
- **Maintains complete context** at every level
- **Adapts** from simple 2-level typo fixes to complex 30-level system implementations

## Dynamic Hierarchy Principles

### Adaptive Depth
- **AI decides** when further decomposition is needed
- **Natural termination** when reaching atomic, unit-testable changes
- **No artificial limits** - depth emerges from code complexity
- **Mixed depths** within same PR (typo = 2 levels, auth system = 30 levels)

### Level Characteristics

#### Root Level (Business Themes)
- **Definition**: Distinct user flow, story, or business capability
- **Examples**: "User Authentication", "Search Optimization", "Fix Documentation Typos"
- **Content**: Complete business context for this theme

#### Intermediate Levels (Dynamic)
- **Definition**: Logical decomposition of parent functionality
- **Depth**: As many levels as needed for clarity
- **Content**: Focused on specific aspect of parent theme

#### Leaf Level (Atomic Changes)
- **Definition**: Smallest unit-testable code change
- **Size**: Typically 5-15 lines of focused change
- **Content**: Specific code diff that could have its own unit test

## Data Structure at Each Level

### Required Information
```yaml
Node:
  id: Unique identifier
  name: Clear, contextual title (audience-appropriate)
  description: Detailed explanation (1-3 sentences)
  businessContext: Why this change matters
  technicalContext: What this change does
  affectedFiles: List of files involved at this level
  codeDiff: Relevant code changes for this specific node
  metrics:
    linesAdded: X
    linesRemoved: Y
    complexity: low|medium|high
  children: [] (empty for leaves)
  crossReferences: [] (IDs of related nodes for shared code)
```

### Context Completeness
- **Self-contained**: Each node has ALL context needed to understand it
- **No inheritance dependency**: Can understand node without traversing tree
- **Progressive detail**: More technical as you go deeper
- **Audience-aware**: Language adapts to expected viewer at each level

## AI Decision Framework

### When to Create Child Nodes
1. **Multiple concerns**: Parent contains distinct functional areas
2. **Complexity threshold**: Single node too complex to understand atomically  
3. **Different audiences**: Technical vs business aspects need separation
4. **Testability**: Changes aren't independently testable at current level

### When to Stop Decomposition
1. **Atomic change**: Code change is unit-testable as-is
2. **Single responsibility**: Node does exactly one thing
3. **Clarity achieved**: Further breakdown adds no value
4. **Natural boundary**: Reached indivisible code unit

## Coverage Philosophy

### Intelligent Coverage (Not Strict Mapping)
- **Primary ownership**: Each code change has a primary home in the mindmap
- **Cross-references allowed**: Shared utilities/components can appear in multiple contexts
- **Context-aware duplication**: Same code shown differently based on usage context
- **AI-managed overlap**: System prevents excessive duplication while allowing necessary repetition

### Examples of Acceptable Overlap
```yaml
Shared Utility Function:
  - Appears in "User Authentication" → showing auth usage
  - Appears in "Admin Dashboard" → showing admin usage
  - Each context shows relevant aspects of the change

Reusable Component:
  - Primary node: "Create Shared Button Component"
  - Reference in: "Update Login UI" (as used component)
  - Reference in: "Redesign Settings Page" (as used component)
```

### Coverage Guidelines
1. **Primary responsibility**: Every change has one primary location
2. **Contextual references**: Additional appearances where genuinely helpful
3. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't duplicate for the sake of completeness
4. **User value focus**: Include where it helps understand user impact

## Examples

### Simple Change (2 levels)
```
Root: "Fix Documentation Typos"
└── Leaf: "README.md: Fix spelling of 'authentication'"
    - Diff: -authntication +authentication
```

### Complex Change with Shared Components
```
Root: "Implement User Authentication"
├── "Add OAuth2 Integration"
│   ├── "Create OAuth Utilities" (PRIMARY)
│   │   └── Leaf: "Add token validation helper"
│   ├── "Google OAuth Provider"
│   │   └── Uses: token validation helper (REFERENCE)
│   └── "GitHub OAuth Provider"
│       └── Uses: token validation helper (REFERENCE)
└── "Secure API Endpoints"
    └── "Add Authentication Middleware"
        └── Uses: token validation helper (REFERENCE)

Root: "Improve Error Handling"
└── "Standardize Error Messages"
    └── "Update OAuth Errors"
        └── Modifies: token validation helper (SECONDARY CONTEXT)
```

## Key Differentiators

### From Fixed Levels
- **Natural organization**: Structure emerges from code, not forced into preset levels
- **Appropriate depth**: Simple changes stay simple, complex changes get proper decomposition
- **No empty levels**: No artificial intermediate nodes just to maintain structure

### Intelligent Cross-Referencing
- **Smart duplication**: AI decides when showing code in multiple contexts adds value
- **Primary vs reference**: Clear indication of where code primarily belongs
- **Context preservation**: Each appearance maintains its specific context

### Complete Context
- **Every node standalone**: Can understand any node without parent context
- **Rich metadata**: Technical + business context at every level
- **Full traceability**: Complete diff information at appropriate granularity

## Success Criteria

1. **Natural Structure**: Depth feels intuitive, not forced
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All changes represented, with intelligent handling of shared code
3. **Minimal Redundancy**: Duplication only where it adds understanding
4. **Standalone Nodes**: Each node understandable in isolation
5. **Testable Leaves**: Every leaf represents unit-testable change
6. **Business Alignment**: Root themes match actual business value
7. **Cross-Reference Clarity**: Shared components clearly marked and linked

## Use Cases

### Code Review
- Navigate to exact level of detail needed
- See all usages of shared components
- Understand change impact across features

### Release Notes
- Auto-generate notes at any abstraction level
- Include cross-cutting changes appropriately
- Maintain full traceability to code

### Impact Analysis
- See all features affected by utility changes
- Understand ripple effects of modifications
- Identify shared dependencies

## Implementation Considerations

### AI Requirements
- Identify shared code and dependencies
- Determine primary vs secondary contexts
- Balance completeness with clarity
- Manage cross-references intelligently

### Performance
- Lazy expansion for large PRs
- Efficient cross-reference indexing
- Cache intermediate analysis results
- Progressive rendering of deep trees

### Validation
- Ensure all code is represented at least once
- Verify cross-references are meaningful
- Check for excessive duplication
- Validate context completeness

This dynamic approach ensures the mindmap naturally reflects code complexity while intelligently handling shared components and utilities, maintaining complete context at every level without forcing rigid one-to-one mappings.
